- Auto Scaling in EC2 and DynamoDB are examples of?
  - Horizontal scaling
  - Vertical scaling
    - Auto Scaling in EC2 allows you to have the right number of instances to handle the application load. Auto Scaling in DynamoDB automatically adjusts read and write throughput capacity, in response to dynamically changing request volumes, with zero downtime. These are both examples of horizontal scaling.
